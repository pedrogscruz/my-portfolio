This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js**, **React.js**, and **Next UI**. It is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load fonts automatically, including styles provided by [Next UI](https://nextui.org/).
